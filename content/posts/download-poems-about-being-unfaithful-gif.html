                It is the only failure. ― dr prem jagyasi. Since there&#039;s been poetry, there&#039;s been love poems. Nothing can be worse than being unfaithful to what your heart bids you to do.

    <h3>The unfaithful lover did not even pass my way.</h3>
    <p>It is the only failure. ― dr prem jagyasi. Cheating poems are about unfaithfulness and forgiveness. If you&#039;ve experienced unreciprocated love, the unrequited love poems are sure to resonate with you. Shakespeare&#039;s farewell thou art too dear is a much better poem, which also matches your needs.</p>
