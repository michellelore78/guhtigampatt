                Continue to explore classic poetry with our pick of valentine&#039;s day poems, these great. Although there are multitudes of stars brilliant against the night, all of that fades when the moon is missingâ€” when the moon has run away to orbit another planet.

    <h3>The harder i am thrown, the higher i bounce.</h3>
    <p>Instead i stay up late write poems about my life think about my state and try to avoid a knife. Why did you leave now that i am learning you? Flowers i&#039;ve made some dirt and cookie fingerprints are not too hard to find, you&#039;ll see them on our walls and drawers, where i go, they&#039;re left behind! That is the only thing going on in my mind.</p>
