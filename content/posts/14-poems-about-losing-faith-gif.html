                It is a feeling we must develop and cultivate, but like faith, it is also. .your name upon the rain and yet it cannot comfort me. It urges believers to hang on to hope through every struggle and trial.
    </p>

    <h3>.your name upon the rain and yet it cannot comfort me.</h3>
    <p>Poems about losing faith the hard way. People who have recently lost someone have a certain look, recognizable maybe only to those who have seen that look on their own faces. I love thee with the passion put to use in my old griefs, and with my childhood&#039;s faith. Losing_faith stories, books, poems, and more.</p>
