    <p><strong>10+ Poems About Being Tired Of Trying Pics</strong>. I am tired of fidgeting to keep my sleeves past mid fingers, because my knuckles are swollen and. I am tired with the feeling of being dismissed, criticized as to what i&#039;m going to do next.</p>

                Here is the text of gorman&#039;s poem, the hill we climb, in full. Sleep hath its own world, a boundary between the things misnamed death and existence: I am tired and sick of war.
    </p>

    <h3>We also don&#039;t know what exactly caused the speaker to walk away.</h3>
    <p>This poem describes the way i often feel about the place i&#039;m living in. I am tired and sick of war. Not because we will never again. They explore the unknown and help to give it shape.</p>

        <p>I am strong, but i am tired, stephen, tired of always having to be the strong one, of always having to do the right thing. i am a detached human being, making my way in a world that is constantly trying to push me aside, and you who send me letters and emails and beautiful gifts wouldn&#039;t even recognise.</p>
