    <p>This poem was written/submitted by mandy. A car is just a car. In my line of work, i have to know a little about cars. It&#039;s fun to watch the trains go by across the world as in the grass you lie so carelessly, and think far thoughts of cities gray, and watch the smoke curls die away across the brook or in the trees;</p>
